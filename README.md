# Cobot Membership Auto-Confirm

## Summary

This script will connect to the Cobot OAuth API on behalf of a user (with admin privileges) and run through the list of members, automatically confirming any unconfirmed members. It requires you to obtain an OAuth Access Token and Access Secret from Cobot, which I'll cover in the _Authorizing This Script_ section below.

## Authorizing This Script
OAuth is better suited to developing interactive web applications that need to access a user's data from an external web service; but with a little IRB magic, it's actually pretty easy to authenticate a non-interactive script to do the same thing.

## Usage
Usage + Configuration info.
